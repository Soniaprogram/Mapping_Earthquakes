# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
Using javascript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data to create different maps outlining earthquake and tectonic plate magnitudes and locations.

### Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data

Using my knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, I added tectonic plate data using d3.json(), added the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and added the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.

Resulting Map (Tectonic Plate Data added):

### Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data

Using my knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, I added major earthquake data to the map using d3.json(), added a color, set the radius of the circle based on the magnitude of earthquake, and added a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, geoJSON().

Resulting Map (Major Earthquake Data added):

### Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

Using my knowledge of JavaScript and Leaflet.js, I added a third map style to my earthquake map. The three map styles are: Streets, Satellite, and Dark. 

Resulting Maps:
